# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
Main focus tool on this project is REACT framework and API call to OpenWeatherMap API. We use React to create a responsive and user-friendly interface, and also use React Router for dynamic rendering of the UI.
